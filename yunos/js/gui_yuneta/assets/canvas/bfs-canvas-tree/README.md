# Tree Data Structures in JavaScript
A tree in computer science is a data structure that has wide use in the field of computing science, has a root, a sub-tree of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes. A clear example of the use of trees is to perform quick searches in databases and represent the hierarchy of HTML DOM. There are different types of trees, however in this entry a binary tree will be implemented and plotted using Canvas and JavaScript.

This is an implementation of the Breadth First Search  algorithm in a binary tree, using Javascript and Canvas.
