# **TLS**

## **ytls.h**
The **ytls.h** header file defines the interface for the TLS (Transport Layer Security) functionality in the Yuneta framework. It provides function declarations and structures for handling secure communication using TLS. Key features include:

- **Initialization & Cleanup:** Functions to initialize and clean up TLS resources.
- **TLS Context Management:** Creation and management of TLS contexts for secure communication.
- **Certificate Handling:** Functions for setting up and managing SSL certificates and private keys.
- **Secure Data Transmission:** Functions for sending and receiving encrypted data over TLS connections.
- **Error Handling & Debugging:** Utilities for logging and debugging TLS-related issues.

## **ytls.c**
The **ytls.c** implementation file contains the actual logic for managing TLS connections. It utilizes OpenSSL to provide encryption and secure communication. Key functionalities implemented include:

- **TLS Context Setup:** Creating, configuring, and destroying SSL contexts.
- **Certificate Loading:** Loading certificates, verifying them, and handling private keys.
- **Connection Handling:** Establishing, reading, writing, and closing TLS-secured connections.
- **Error Reporting:** Logging and handling OpenSSL-related errors.
- **Secure Communication:** Encrypting and decrypting data sent over a TLS connection.

This module ensures that Yuneta applications can securely transmit data over the network using industry-standard encryption protocols.

# Philosophy of ytls
The **ytls** module is built with the core philosophy of Yuneta in mind:

- **Security as a Priority:** Ensuring that all data transmitted over the network is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping or tampering.
- **Minimalism & Efficiency:** Providing a streamlined, efficient implementation that integrates seamlessly with the Yuneta framework.
- **Reliability & Stability:** Using OpenSSL as the underlying cryptographic library to ensure robust and well-tested security mechanisms.
- **Flexibility:** Allowing customization of TLS parameters, certificates, and cipher suites to meet diverse application needs.
- **Ease of Use:** Abstracting complex TLS operations while giving developers a simple and consistent API for secure communication.

By following these principles, **ytls** ensures that Yuneta-based applications maintain strong security without unnecessary complexity.
