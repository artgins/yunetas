(gclass-c-tranger)=
## C_TRANGER

Time-range database manager — wraps **timeranger2** for CRUD operations
on time-series topics.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **States** | `ST_STOPPED`, `ST_IDLE` |

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `topics` | List all topics: their names, or with `expanded=1` a desc each (`{topic_name, system_flag, pkey, tkey, topic_version}`). `system_flag` is what tells whether the topic's `t`/`tm` are seconds or **milliseconds** (`sf_t_ms` / `sf_tm_ms`). |
| `create-topic` | Create a new topic. |
| `open-topic` | Open an existing topic. |
| `delete-topic` | Delete a topic. |
| `open-list` / `close-list` | Open or close a record list (one-shot snapshot with `return_data=1`, else a live list collecting realtime appends). A **keyless** list accepts `rkey` (PCRE2 regex over the keys), and it governs both the disk load **and** the realtime feed. |
| `get-list-data` | Retrieve an open list's data. |
| `list-keys` | List a topic's keys with their record counts **and their time span on both axes**: `[{key, records, fr_t, to_t, fr_tm, to_tm}]`. Lets a client bound a time picker to what the key really holds without reading a record. Filters, sorts and pages **in the server**: `rkey` (PCRE2 regex), `order=key\|records` + `desc`, and `from`/`limit` (with `limit>0` the answer is a page `{total_rows, pages, data}`; `limit=0` keeps the plain full list). |
| `open-iterator` / `close-iterator` | Open/close a stateful per-key iterator (row index only, no upfront load) for cursor pagination. Takes the match conditions below; a filtered iterator indexes the matching rows at open, so `total_rows` and the pages count only those. |
| `get-page` | Get a page `{total_rows, pages, data}` from an open iterator (`limit`, optional `backward`). `from_rowid` is 1-based and, on a **filtered** iterator, is a position among the MATCHING rows (a global rowid only when the iterator does not filter). |
| `open-rt` / `close-rt` | Open/close a realtime feed on a topic key (no history load); new appends are published as `EV_TRANGER_RECORD_ADDED` to subscribers. |
| `add-record` | Append a record. |
| `print-tranger` | Dump tranger state as bounded JSON (`expanded`, `lists_limit`/`dicts_limit`; unexpanded containers answer as `[[size]]`). |
| `desc` | Describe topic schema. |

**`open-iterator` match conditions** (all optional; `0`/empty = unset):
`from_t`/`to_t`, `from_tm`/`to_tm`, `from_rowid`/`to_rowid`, `backward`, and the
user_flag conditions (`user_flag`, `not_user_flag`, `user_flag_mask_set`,
`user_flag_mask_notset`). They are ANDed, and every one is honored **per
record**.

A tranger record carries **two independent timestamps**, and a browser of raw
records needs both:

| Axis | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `t`  | **Persistence** time — when the record was appended to the topic. |
| `tm` | **Message** time — when the event it carries actually happened (the record's `tkey` field, set by the producer). |

They diverge whenever data is backfilled or a device uploads a buffered batch
late. Both are expressed in the **topic's** unit — seconds, unless its
`system_flag` sets `sf_t_ms` / `sf_tm_ms` (ask `topics expanded=1`).

(gclass-c-treedb)=
## C_TREEDB

Hierarchical tree database manager — manages **TreeDB** instances on top
of timeranger with JSON schema support.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **States** | `ST_STOPPED`, `ST_IDLE` |

### Key attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `path` | `string` | Storage path. |
| `filename_mask` | `string` | Filename pattern. |
| `master` | `bool` | `TRUE` for master, `FALSE` for read-only replica. |
| `exit_on_error` | `bool` | Exit on schema errors. |

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `open-treedb` / `close-treedb` | Open or close a treedb instance. |
| `delete-treedb` | Delete a treedb and its data. |
| `create-topic` / `delete-topic` | Manage topics within a treedb. |

---

(gclass-c-node)=
## C_NODE

Node resource interface for TreeDB — full CRUD and graph operations on
tree nodes with linking, snapshots, and import/export.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **States** | `ST_STOPPED`, `ST_IDLE` |

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `create-node` / `update-node` / `delete-node` | CRUD operations on nodes. |
| `node` / `nodes` | Retrieve one node / list a topic's nodes (with filters). |
| `instances` | List node instances. |
| `link-nodes` / `unlink-nodes` | Manage parent-child relationships. |
| `parents` / `children` | Navigate the graph. |
| `hooks` / `links` | Inspect hook and fkey relationships. |
| `jtree` | Get a node's full subtree as JSON. |
| `shoot-snap` / `activate-snap` / `deactivate-snap` | Snapshot management. |
| `snaps` / `snap-content` | Inspect snapshots. |
| `import-db` / `export-db` | Bulk import/export. |
| `treedbs` / `topics` | List the treedbs of the tranger / the topics of a treedb. |
| `desc` / `descs` | Describe one topic's schema / every topic's. |
| `print-tranger` | Dump the tranger the treedb lives on as bounded JSON (`kw_collapse()`-truncated: unexpanded containers answer as `[[size]]`; `lists_limit`/`dicts_limit` bound the expansion). Pass `path=` (backtick-delimited, `kw_find_path` style, arrays by numeric index) to lazily drill into one subtree — this is what feeds the gui_treedb "Raw JSON" viewer. |

| Property | Value |

| **States** | `ST_STOPPED`, `ST_IDLE` |

### Key attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `strict` | `bool` | Enable schema validation. |
| `json_desc` | `json` | Resource schema descriptor. |
| `persistent` | `bool` | Persist to disk. |
| `service` | `string` | Service name. |
| `database` | `string` | Database name. |
