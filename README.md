`Yuneta Simplified` is a **development framework** focused on **messaging** and **services**, based on
[Event-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming),
[Automata-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata-based_programming)
and [Object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
programming paradigms.
Heavy use of JSON, **serie-time**, **key-value**, **flat-files** and **graphs** concepts.

[Yuneta Simplified](https://yuneta.io) is a **real-time system** RTS that includes **development**, **testing**, and **deployment** features. Built for Linux, and **deployable** on any **bare-metal** server. Too it has been ported successfully to [ESP-IDF](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf), a basic version.

Specialized in IoT data collection, all types of devices, and data exchange and protocol adaptation between systems, including collection, **publication/subscription**, and querying of **messages** in **real time**, with **historical** data storage.

The messages (**encrypted** or plain text) circulating within the Yuneta system can be persistent in disk or exist only while in transit or in the memory of a service. All data in JSON.

For [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and [RTOS/ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf).

Versions in C, partially in JavaScript. Future in Python.
