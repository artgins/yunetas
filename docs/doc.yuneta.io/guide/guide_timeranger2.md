# **Timeranger2**

**Timeranger2** is a time-series data storage and retrieval system designed for efficient event tracking and data management. It is a core component of **Yuneta**, operating based on **TimeRanger Philosophy**, where data is stored as **key-value pairs** in **flat files** with timestamp indexing.

## Features

- **Time-Series Storage:** Stores data in a time-ordered format for efficient querying.
- **Flat File System:** Utilizes simple yet optimized storage mechanisms for performance.
- **Key-Value Data Model:** Stores records with parent-child relationships, forming a structured hierarchy.
- **Efficient Querying:** Enables retrieval of time-based data segments quickly.
- **Hierarchical Organization:** Supports **one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one** relationships.
- **Event-Based Processing:** Works in sync with Yuneta's event-driven architecture.

## Architecture

- **Files and Memory:** Operates primarily on flat files while maintaining essential structures in memory.
- **Indexing:** Uses timestamp-based indexing for efficient access to time-sequenced data.
- **Hierarchical Data Handling:** Facilitates relationships between stored records.

## Use Cases

- **Event Logging:** Track and analyze system or application events over time.
- **Monitoring & Metrics Collection:** Store and retrieve time-based metrics for analytics.
- **Data Persistence for Applications:** Act as a persistent backend for event-driven applications.

## Relationship with Yuneta

- **Integrated with Yuneta’s Object Model**: Works alongside `gobj` architecture for seamless event handling.
- **Persistence & Retrieval**: Complements **Treedb** by focusing on long-term storage and efficient retrieval.

Timeranger2 is optimized for scenarios where structured time-based data is essential, making it a key component of Yuneta’s ecosystem.
